/**
 * A storage location for one particular snapshot, offering data persistent, metadata persistence,
 * and lifecycle/cleanup methods.
 *
 * <p>It is also a factory of a snapshot stream that produces streams that write to a {@link
 * FileSystem}. The streams from the factory put their data into files with a random name, within
 * the given directory.
 *
 * <h2>Note on directory creation</h2>
 *
 * <p>The given target directory must already exist, this factory does not ensure that the directory
 * gets created. That is important, because if this factory checked for directory existence, there
 * would be many checks per snapshot and such floods of directory existence checks can be
 * prohibitive on larger scale setups for some file systems.
 *
 * <p>For example many S3 file systems (like Hadoop's s3a) use HTTP HEAD requests to check for the
 * existence of a directory. S3 sometimes limits the number of HTTP HEAD requests to a few hundred
 * per second only. Those numbers are easily reached by moderately large setups. Surprisingly (and
 * fortunately), the actual kv files writing (POST) have much higher quotas.
