/**
 * Hierarchical Timing Wheels.
 *
 * <p>A simple timing wheel is a circular list of buckets of timer tasks. Let u be the time unit. A
 * timing wheel with size n has n buckets and can hold timer tasks in n * u time interval. Each
 * bucket holds timer tasks that fall into the corresponding time range. At the beginning, the first
 * bucket holds tasks for [0, u), the second bucket holds tasks for [u, 2u), …, the n-th bucket for
 * [u * (n -1), u * n). Every interval of time unit u, the timer ticks and moved to the next bucket
 * then expire all timer tasks in it. So, the timer never insert a task into the bucket for the
 * current time since it is already expired. The timer immediately runs the expired task. The
 * emptied bucket is then available for the next round, so if the current bucket is for the time t,
 * it becomes the bucket for [t + u * n, t + (n + 1) * u) after a tick. A timing wheel has O(1) cost
 * for insert/delete (start-timer/stop-timer) whereas priority queue based timers, such as {@link
 * DelayQueue} and {@link Timer}, have O(log n) insert/delete cost.
 *
 * <p>A major drawback of a simple timing wheel is that it assumes that a timer request is within
 * the time interval of n * u from the current time. If a timer request is out of this interval, it
 * is an overflow. A hierarchical timing wheel deals with such overflows. It is a hierarchically
 * organized timing wheels. The lowest level has the finest time resolution. As moving up the
 * hierarchy, time resolutions become coarser. If the resolution of a wheel at one level is u and
 * the size is n, the resolution of the next level should be n * u. At each level overflows are
 * delegated to the wheel in one level higher. When the wheel in the higher level ticks, it reinsert
 * imer tasks to the lower level. An overflow wheel can be created on-demand. When a bucket in an
 * overflow bucket expires, all tasks in it are reinserted into the timer recursively. The tasks are
 * then moved to the finer grain wheels or be executed. The insert (start-timer) cost is O(m) where
 * m is the number of wheels, which is usually very small compared to the number of requests in the
 * system, and the delete (stop-timer) cost is still O(1).
 *
 * <p>Example Let's say that u is 1 and n is 3. If the start time is c, then the buckets at
 * different levels are:
 *
 * <pre>
 * level   buckets
 * 1       [c,c] [c+1,c+1] [c+2,c+2]
 * 2       [c,c+2] [c+3,c+5] [c+6,c+8]
 * 3       [c,c+8] [c+9,c+17] [c+18,c+26]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The bucket expiration is at the time of bucket beginning. So at time = c+1, buckets [c,c],
 * [c,c+2] and [c,c+8] are expired. Level 1's clock moves to c+1, and [c+3,c+3] is created. Level 2
 * and level3's clock stay at c since their clocks move in unit of 3 and 9, respectively. So, no new
 * buckets are created in level 2 and 3.
 *
 * <p>Note that bucket [c,c+2] in level 2 won't receive any task since that range is already covered
 * in level 1. The same is true for the bucket [c,c+8] in level 3 since its range is covered in
 * level 2. This is a bit wasteful, but simplifies the implementation.
 *
 * <pre>
 * level   buckets
 * 1       [c+1,c+1]  [c+2,c+2]  [c+3,c+3]
 * 2       [c,c+2]    [c+3,c+5]  [c+6,c+8]
 * 3       [c,c+8]    [c+9,c+17] [c+18,c+26]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>At time = c+2, [c+1,c+1] is newly expired. Level 1 moves to c+2, and [c+4,c+4] is created,
 *
 * <pre>
 * level   buckets
 * 1       [c+2,c+2] [c+3,c+3] [c+4,c+4]
 * 2       [c,c+2] [c+3,c+5] [c+6,c+8]
 * 3       [c,c+8] [c+9,c+17] [c+18,c+26]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>At time = c+3, [c+2,c+2] is newly expired. Level 2 moves to c+3, and [c+5,c+5] and [c+9,c+11]
 * are created. Level 3 stay at c.
 *
 * <pre>
 * level   buckets
 * 1      [c+3,c+3] [c+4,c+4] [c+5,c+5]
 * 2      [c+3,c+5] [c+6,c+8] [c+9,c+11]
 * 3      [c,c+8]   [c+9,c+17] [c+18,c+26]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The hierarchical timing wheels works especially well when operations are completed before they
 * time out. Even when everything times out, it still has advantageous when there are many items in
 * the timer. Its insert cost (including reinsert) and delete cost are O(m) and O(1), respectively
 * while priority queue based timers takes O(log N) for both insert and delete where N is the number
 * of items in the queue.
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe. There should not be any add calls while advanceClock is
 * executing. It is caller's responsibility to enforce it. Simultaneous add calls are thread-safe.
