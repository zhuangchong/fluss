# Metric Reporters

Fluss allows reporting [metrics](monitor-metrics.md) to external system. 
Metrics can be exposed to an external system by configuring one or several reporters in `conf/server.yaml`. These 
reporters will be instantiated on each CoordinatorServer and TabletServers when they started.

Example reporter configuration that specifies multiple reporters:

```yaml
metrics.reporters: jmx,prometheus
```

## Push vs. Pull

Metrics are exported either via pushes or pulls.

Push-based reporters usually implement the `Scheduled` interface and periodically send a summary of current metrics to an external system.

Pull-based reporters are queried from an external system instead.

## Reporters

The following sections list the supported reporters currently.

### JMX

Type: pull

Parameters:

- `port` - (optional) the port on which JMX listens for connections.
  In order to be able to run several instances of the reporter on one host (e.g. when one TabletServer is co-located with the CoordinatorServer) it is advisable to use a port range like `9250-9260`.
  When a range is specified the actual port is shown in the relevant server log.
  If this setting is set, Fluss will start an extra JMX connector for the given port/range.
  Metrics are always available on the default local JMX interface.

Example configuration:

```yaml
metrics.reporters: jmx
metrics.reporter.jmx.port: 9250-9260
```

Metrics exposed through JMX are identified by a domain and a list of key-properties, which together form the object name.

The domain always begins with `com.alibaba.fluss` followed by a generalized metric identifier.
An example for such a domain would be `com.alibaba.fluss.tabletserver.replicaCount`.

The key-property list contains the values for all variables, that are associated
with a given metric.
An example for such a list would be `cluster_id=fluss1,host=localhost,server_id=1`.

The domain thus identifies a metric class, while the key-property list identifies one (or multiple) instances of that metric.

### Prometheus

Type: pull

Parameters:

- `metrics.reporter.prometheus.port` - (optional) the port the Prometheus exporter listens on, defaults to [9249](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations). In order to be able to run several instances of the reporter on one host (e.g. when one TabletServer is co-located with the CoordinatorServer) it is advisable to use a port range like `9250-9260`.

Example configuration:

```yaml
metrics.reporters: prometheus
metrics.reporter.prometheus.port: 9250
```

Fluss metric types are mapped to Prometheus metric types as follows:

| Fluss     | Prometheus | Note                                     |
| --------- |------------|------------------------------------------|
| Counter   | Gauge      |Prometheus counters cannot be decremented.|
| Gauge     | Gauge      |Only numbers and booleans are supported.  |
| Histogram | Summary    |Quantiles .5, .75, .95, .98, .99 and .999 |
| Meter     | Gauge      |The gauge exports the meter's rate.       |
