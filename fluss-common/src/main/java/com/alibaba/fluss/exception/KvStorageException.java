/**
 * Storage Exception for Kv.
 *
 * <p>Miscellaneous disk-related IOException occurred when handling a request. Client should request
 * metadata update and retry if the response shows {@link KvStorageException}.
 *
 * <p>Here are the guidelines on how to handle {@link KvStorageException} and IOException:
 * <li>1) If the server has not finished loading kvs, IOException does not need to be converted to
 *     {@link KvStorageException}
 * <li>2) After the server has finished loading kvs, IOException should be converted and re-thrown
 *     as {@link KvStorageException}
 * <li>3) It is preferred for IOException to be caught in KvTablet rather than in ReplicaManager
 *
