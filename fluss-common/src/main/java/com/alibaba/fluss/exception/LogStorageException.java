/**
 * Storage Exception for Log.
 *
 * <p>Miscellaneous disk-related IOException occurred when handling a request. Client should request
 * metadata update and retry if the response shows {@link LogStorageException}.
 *
 * <p>Here are the guidelines on how to handle {@link LogStorageException} and IOException:
 * <li>1) If the server has not finished loading logs, IOException does not need to be converted to
 *     {@link LogStorageException}
 * <li>2) After the server has finished loading logs, IOException should be converted and re-thrown
 *     as {@link LogStorageException}
 * <li>3) It is preferred for IOException to be caught in LocalLog rather than in ReplicaManager or
 *     LogSegment
