/**
 * Indicates that a request API or version needed by the client is not supported by the server. This

 * cases where a needed feature is not available in old versions. Fatal errors can generally only be
 * handled by closing the client instance, although in some cases it may be possible to continue
 * without relying on the underlying feature.
