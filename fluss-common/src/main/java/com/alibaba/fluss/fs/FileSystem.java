/**
 * Abstract base class of all file systems used by Fluss. This class may be extended to implement
 * distributed file systems, or local file systems. The abstraction by this file system is very
 * simple, and the set of available operations quite limited, to support the common denominator of a
 * wide range of file systems. For example, appending to or mutating existing files is not
 * supported.
 *
 * <p>Fluss implements and supports some file system types directly (for example the default
 * machine-local file system). Other file system types are accessed by an implementation that
 * bridges to the suite of file systems supported by Hadoop (such as for example HDFS).
 *
 * <h2>Scope and Purpose</h2>
 *
 * <p>The purpose of this abstraction is used to expose a common and well defined interface for
 * access to files. This abstraction is used both by Fluss's fault tolerance mechanism (recovery
 * data) in KV Store and tiered storage in Log Store .
 *
 * <h2>Data Persistence Contract</h2>
 *
 * <p>The FileSystem's {@link FSDataOutputStream output streams} are used to persistently store
 * data, both for checkpoints of KV Store and for tiered storage of Log Store. It is therefore
 * crucial that the persistence semantics of these streams are well defined.
 *
 * <h3>Definition of Persistence Guarantees</h3>
 *
 * <p>Data written to an output stream is considered persistent, if two requirements are met:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Visibility Requirement:</b> It must be guaranteed that all other processes, machines,
 *       virtual machines, containers, etc. that are able to access the file see the data
 *       consistently when given the absolute file path. This requirement is similar to the
 *       <i>close-to-open</i> semantics defined by POSIX, but restricted to the file itself (by its
 *       absolute path).
 *   <li><b>Durability Requirement:</b> The file system's specific durability/persistence
 *       requirements must be met. These are specific to the particular file system. For example the
 *       {@link LocalFileSystem} does not provide any durability guarantees for crashes of both
 *       hardware and operating system, while replicated distributed file systems (like HDFS)
 *       typically guarantee durability in the presence of at most <i>n</i> concurrent node
 *       failures, where <i>n</i> is the replication factor.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Updates to the file's parent directory (such that the file shows up when listing the directory
 * contents) are not required to be complete for the data in the file stream to be considered
 * persistent. This relaxation is important for file systems where updates to directory contents are
 * only eventually consistent.
 *
 * <p>The {@link FSDataOutputStream} has to guarantee data persistence for the written bytes once
 * the call to {@link FSDataOutputStream#close()} returns.
 *
 * <h3>Examples</h3>
 *
 * <h4>Fault-tolerant distributed file systems</h4>
 *
 * <p>For <b>fault-tolerant distributed file systems</b>, data is considered persistent once it has
 * been received and acknowledged by the file system, typically by having been replicated to a
 * quorum of machines (<i>durability requirement</i>). In addition the absolute file path must be
 * visible to all other machines that will potentially access the file (<i>visibility
 * requirement</i>).
 *
 * <p>Whether data has hit non-volatile storage on the storage nodes depends on the specific
 * guarantees of the particular file system.
 *
 * <p>The metadata updates to the file's parent directory are not required to have reached a
 * consistent state. It is permissible that some machines see the file when listing the parent
 * directory's contents while others do not, as long as access to the file by its absolute path is
 * possible on all nodes.
 *
 * <h4>Local file systems</h4>
 *
 * <p>A <b>local file system</b> must support the POSIX <i>close-to-open</i> semantics. Because the
 * local file system does not have any fault tolerance guarantees, no further requirements exist.
 *
 * <p>The above implies specifically that data may still be in the OS cache when considered
 * persistent from the local file system's perspective. Crashes that cause the OS cache to lose data
 * are considered fatal to the local machine and are not covered by the local file system's
 * guarantees as defined by Fluss.
 *
 * <p>That means that checkpoints of KV Store that are written only to the local filesystem are not
 * guaranteed to be recoverable from the local machine's failure, making local file systems
 * unsuitable for production setups.
 *
 * <h2>Updating File Contents</h2>
 *
 * <p>Many file systems either do not support overwriting contents of existing files at all, or do
 * not support consistent visibility of the updated contents in that case. For that reason, FLuss's
 * FileSystem does not support appending to existing files, or seeking within output streams so that
 * previously written data could be overwritten.
 *
 * <h2>Overwriting Files</h2>
 *
 * <p>Overwriting files is in general possible. A file is overwritten by deleting it and creating a
 * new file. However, certain filesystems cannot make that change synchronously visible to all
 * parties that have access to the file. For example <a
 * href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/">Amazon S3</a> guarantees only <i>eventual
 * consistency</i> in the visibility of the file replacement: Some machines may see the old file,
 * some machines may see the new file.
 *
 * <p>To avoid these consistency issues, the implementations of failure/recovery mechanisms in Fluss
 * strictly avoid writing to the same file path more than once.
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of {@code FileSystem} must be thread-safe: The same instance of FileSystem is
 * frequently shared across multiple threads in Fluss and must be able to concurrently create
 * input/output streams and list file metadata.
 *
 * <p>The {@link FSDataInputStream} and {@link FSDataOutputStream} implementations are strictly
 * <b>not thread-safe</b>. Instances of the streams should also not be passed between threads in
 * between read or write operations, because there are no guarantees about the visibility of
 * operations across threads (many operations do not create memory fences).
 *
 * <h2>Streams Safety Net</h2>
 *
 * <p>After call method {@link FileSystemSafetyNet#initializeSafetyNetForThread()}, and then obtains
 * a FileSystem (via {@link FileSystem#get(URI)} or via {@link FsPath#getFileSystem()}), the
 * FileSystem instantiates a safety net for that FileSystem. The safety net ensures that all streams
 * created from the FileSystem are tracked and can be closed via method {@link
 * FileSystemSafetyNet#closeSafetyNetAndGuardedResourcesForThread()}.
 *
 * <p>It also exposes a method {@link FileSystem#getUnguardedFileSystem(URI)} to provide a
 * FileSystem that does not use the safety net.
