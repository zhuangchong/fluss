## What is Fluss?

Fluss is a streaming storage built for real-time analytics which can serve as the real-time data layer for Lakehouse architectures.

It bridges the gap between **data streaming** and **data Lakehouse** by enabling low-latency, high-throughput data ingestion and processing while seamlessly integrating with popular compute engines like **Apache Flink**, while Apache Spark, and StarRocks are coming soon.

**Fluss (German: river, pronounced `/flus/`)** enables streaming data continuously converging, distributing and flowing into lakes, like a river 🌊

## Building

Prerequisites for building Fluss:

- Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
- Git
- Maven (we require version >= 3.8.6)
- Java 8 or 11

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/fluss.git
cd fluss
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Fluss is now installed in `build-target`.
