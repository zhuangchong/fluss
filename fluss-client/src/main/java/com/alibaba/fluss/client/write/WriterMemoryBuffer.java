/**
 * A pool of {@link MemorySegment} kept under a given memory limit. This class is fairly specific to
 * the needs of the {@link WriterClient}. In particular, it has the following properties:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>There is a special "page size" and segments of this size are kept in freePages and
 *       recycled. The page size is configure by conf {@link
 *       ConfigOptions#CLIENT_WRITER_LEGACY_BATCH_SIZE}.
 *   <li>It is fair. That is all memory is given to the longest waiting thread until it has
 *       sufficient memory. This prevents starvation or deadlock when a thread asks for a large
 *       chunk of memory and needs to block until multiple segments are deallocated. The total pool
 *       managed memory is configured by conf {@link
 *       ConfigOptions#CLIENT_WRITER_BUFFER_MEMORY_SIZE}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Note: This class will be removed, after we uniform this class with {@link MemorySegmentPool}.
